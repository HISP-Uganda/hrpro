# Notes Directory

This directory is intended to contain module‑specific notes created during development.  For each milestone or module you complete, create a new markdown file here summarising:

* Important design decisions and trade‑offs.
* API endpoints or Wails bindings added or modified.
* Test cases written and their outcomes.
* Any deviations from `docs/requirements.md` and the rationale behind them.

Examples:

* `auth.md` – notes about the authentication implementation, token lifetimes, and refresh strategies.
* `shell.md` – notes on the dashboard shell and navigation testing.
* `employees.md` – notes on the employees module API and UI behaviours.

By maintaining detailed notes here, future developers and reviewers can quickly understand the context behind your implementation choices and ensure continuity across milestones.
